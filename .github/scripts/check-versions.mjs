/**
 * One version number, everywhere it is written down.
 *
 * Both editions share one version number and one history. A test suite cannot
 * notice that promise being broken: both suites still pass while npm says 1.2.0
 * and PyPI says 1.1.0. So it is checked here instead.
 *
 * The list below is this package's places. It is data rather than code because
 * packages differ - one that also exports a VERSION constant has five places,
 * and the fifth is exactly the one that drifts, since nothing else reads it.
 *
 * With --expect <version> (used by the release workflow) the pushed tag has to
 * agree with all of them as well. A tag that does not match the code is how a
 * v1.2.0 release ends up containing 1.1.0 on npm.
